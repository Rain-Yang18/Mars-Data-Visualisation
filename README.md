# Web Scraping - Mission to Mars

## Introduction
The purpose of this challenge is to build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

## Web Scraping
Complete web scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter using Jupyter notebook.

### NASA Mars News
* Scrape the [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text.

* Use Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string.

### Mars Hemispheres
* Visit the [USGS Astrogeology site](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres.
